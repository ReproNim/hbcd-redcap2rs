We refer to these below as your \"family culture.\" While we ALL live in America, when we refer to \"American\" culture in the following items, we mean cultural practices or traditions that are NOT part of your family's ethnic, religious, or other cultural practices, but that are practiced often as part of \"American\" culture. \n\nPlease select all that apply. \n\nIf you do not identify with a culture other than American, select \"none\".
